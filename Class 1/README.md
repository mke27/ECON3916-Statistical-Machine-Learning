## 🌍 Global Purchasing Power Parity Analysis

### Objective
To empirically test the **Law of One Price** by using the Big Mac Index as a proxy for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) across countries.

---

### Methodology
- Constructed a structured dataset from **The Economist’s 2015 Big Mac Index** using manually defined Python dictionaries  
- Calculated **implied PPP exchange rates** by comparing local Big Mac prices to the U.S. benchmark  
- Computed the **percentage currency valuation** (overvaluation or undervaluation) relative to the U.S. dollar  
- Analyzed deviations from parity to assess the presence of market frictions and limits to arbitrage  

---

### Key Findings
The analysis reveals systematic deviations from Purchasing Power Parity, suggesting that exchange rates do not fully equalize the price of identical goods across countries.  
In particular, the Norwegian Krone was found to be overvalued by 31.5% relative to the U.S. dollar, indicating that the local currency buys relatively more in international terms than implied by the Law of One Price.

These persistent misalignments highlight the role of **transport costs, non-tradable inputs, taxation, and price rigidities**, and demonstrate why PPP is better understood as a **long-run equilibrium condition** rather than a short-run arbitrage rule.
