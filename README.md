# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository serves as my academic and technical portfolio for **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**. It showcases my work at the intersection of **economic theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning**.

## 👋 About Me

I am an undergraduate economics student actively preparing for roles in **Data Analysis / Economic Consulting / Finance**.  
My academic focus is on developing strong empirical skills and learning how to translate economic questions into data-driven insights.

This portfolio reflects my goal of **bridging traditional economic reasoning with modern data science techniques**—combining interpretability, causal thinking, and predictive power.

## 📁 About This Portfolio

This repository contains coursework, labs, and applied projects from **ECON 3916**.

### Course Philosophy: *Concept Extension*
Rather than treating machine learning as a black box, this course follows a **concept extension approach**:

- We begin with foundational econometric tools (e.g., OLS regression, hypothesis testing)
- We then **extend these ideas** using machine learning methods (e.g., Lasso, regularization, cross-validation)
- Emphasis is placed on understanding **both causal inference and predictive performance**

Through this work, I am learning how to:
- Balance **interpretability vs. accuracy**
- Apply ML tools responsibly in economic settings
- Think critically about model assumptions and real-world implications
